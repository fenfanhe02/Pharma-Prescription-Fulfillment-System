# Challenge: Pharma Prescription Fulfillment Frontend System

## Overview

You are tasked with building the frontend interface of a **Pharma Prescription Fulfillment System**. This system is designed for **pharmacy staff** to manage prescriptions, drugs, pharmacies, and audit logs. The backend is not provided ‚Äî all API interactions must be **mocked using realistic data**.

The goal is to build a maintainable, modular web application that covers core functionality and meets business logic requirements. You are free to choose your **UI library** (e.g., Vant, Element Plus, Vuetify), but must use **Vue 3 + TypeScript**, and demonstrate **form validation**, **state management**, **error handling**, and **testing discipline**.

## Functional Stories

### 1. üì¶ Manage Drugs

**Goal**: View and add drugs to the inventory

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** I open the Drug Management page  
  **When** the page loads

  **When** it's displayed  
  **Then** it should be visually marked as expired

- **Given** I fill the "Add Drug" form  
  **When** all fields are valid and submitted  
  **Then** the drug is added to the list and success message shown

- **Given** any form field is invalid
